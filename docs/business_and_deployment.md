## 2. Go-to-Market Strategy

Our go-to-market strategy is inspired by the successful approach of ScrapeCreators, focusing on a lean and developer-centric marketing model.

### 2.1. Launch Strategy

1.  **MVP Launch**: Launch with a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the core scraping API for the most popular platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).
2.  **Free Trial**: Offer a generous free trial with 100 credits to encourage developers to try the API.
3.  **Personal Guarantee**: Implement a personal guarantee similar to ScrapeCreators: "If you don't make a successful request within 30 seconds of signing up, I'll give you 10,000 free credits."

### 2.2. Customer Acquisition

*   **Content Marketing**: Create a blog with high-quality tutorials and articles on web scraping, social media APIs, and data analysis.
*   **Social Media Engagement**: Actively participate in developer communities on Twitter, Reddit (r/webscraping, r/node), and other relevant forums.
*   **Launch Video Strategy**: As demonstrated by Adrian Horning, comment on relevant launch videos on YouTube and other platforms, offering free credits to try the API.
*   **SEO**: Optimize the website and blog content for search engines to attract organic traffic.
