*   **Secondary Goal**: To achieve a high level of customer satisfaction through a reliable and easy-to-use API, backed by excellent documentation and support.
*   **Financial Goal**: To replicate the success of ScrapeCreators, aiming for a high profit margin (approx. 80%) by keeping operational costs low.

### 1.3. Target Audience

*   **Developers**: Individual developers and small teams building applications that require social media data.
*   **Businesses**: Companies in market research, ad intelligence, influencer marketing, and competitive analysis.
*   **SaaS builders**: Entrepreneurs creating B2B applications that leverage social media analytics.

## 5. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   **Assumption**: The user will provide access to an AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage the required resources.
*   **Assumption**: The user has a registered domain name that can be used for the marketing website and API endpoints.
*   **Dependency**: The platform relies on the availability of public data from the supported social media platforms. Changes to these platforms may require updates to the scrapers.
*   **Dependency**: The billing system will use a third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe) for handling credit card payments.

## 6. Out of Scope

The following features are considered out of scope for the initial version of the product:

*   Scraping of private or authenticated data.
*   A mobile application for managing the account.
*   Advanced analytics and data visualization features beyond the basic usage chart.
*   Support for webhooks or real-time data streaming.
